## Our Mission
Our mission is to foster a culture of lifelong learning and critical thinking by empowering undergraduate students to build consistent, meaningful reading habits for pleasure. Through leveraging social connections, personalized goals, shared annotations, and tailored book recommendations, we aim to transform reading from an isolated activity into a vibrant, supportive community experience, helping students stay motivated, engaged, and connected to their reading journeys.
